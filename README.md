A project by Alston Duncan.
The idea for this game is to create a game where a runningback has to dodge opposing defenders. I want to have a different score counter and starting menu. I want to be able to control the rate and speed of the players to make the game more difficult as you play. If I can figure out how to add challenges to the game that will be an added bonus. My goal is also to have a basic starting screen that enables button fuctioanllity to start and quit the game. I also want to change the exsisting theme to a football related theme instead of a mouse theme. The starting screen will have the title of the game and these buttons. I have found some general code for a dodging game and would like to base my game off of it. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44812601/im-trying-to-make-a-dodging-game-with-pygame. I will also be basing my game off of the previously created mouse-dodging-game.
